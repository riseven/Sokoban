# Sokoban

*A single-box sokoban AI solver.*

A little context on this. I was at the first enterprise dinning for the startup Swiss Mobility Solutions,
and the conversation went about programming tests done for screening job aplications there and in other
places. One of the tests wich was commented was the problem a single box sokoban. There is a sokoban level
with only one box and one target point for the box. The objective is to do an AI to solve it. A normal
path finding for the box is not enought since it could block the player, so the search is done over a 
slighthy more complex state space.

The dinner went extremely well, as in any early stage startup, and lot of wine were served. Fast forward to
4 on the morning, and there I am, in my bed and notoriously drunk. But I cannot stop thinking about the
sokoban problem, so I decide to power on my laptop and solve it. After three hours the problem was solved,
including a graphical interface to see the solutions in motion :-).
